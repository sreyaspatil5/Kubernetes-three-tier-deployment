# kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup

kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup is a container image based on Alpine Linux. This container is designed to run in Kubernetes as a cronjob to perform automatic backups of MySQL databases to Amazon S3. It was created to meet my requirements for regular and automatic database backups. Having started with a relatively basic feature set, it is gradually growing to add more and more features.

Currently, kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup supports the backing up of MySQL Databases. It can perform backups of multiple MySQL databases from a single database host. When triggered, a full database dump is performed using the `mysqldump` command for each configured database. The backup(s) are then uploaded to an Amazon S3 Bucket. kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup features Slack Integration, and can post messages into a channel detailing if the backup(s) were successful or not.

Over time, kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup will be updated to support more features and functionality. I currently use this container as part of my Kubernetes Architecture which you can read about [here](https://benjamin.maynard.io/this-blog-now-runs-on-kubernetes-heres-the-architecture/).

All changes are captured in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), which adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/vadheres2.0.0.html).

## Slack Integration

kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup supports posting into Slack after each backup job completes. The message posted into the Slack Channel varies as detailed below:

* If the backup job is **SUCCESSFUL**: A generic message will be posted into the Slack Channel detailing that all database backups successfully completed.
* If the backup job is **UNSUCCESSFUL**: A message will be posted into the Slack Channel with a detailed error message for each database that failed.

In order to configure kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup to post messages into Slack, you need to create an [Incoming WebHook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks). Once generated, you can configure kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup using the environment variables detailed above.

## Configuring the S3 Bucket & AWS IAM User

kubernetes-s3-mysql-backup performs a backup to the same path, with the same filename each time it runs. It therefore assumes that you have Versioning enabled on your S3 Bucket. A typical setup would involve S3 Versioning, with a Lifecycle Policy.

An IAM Users should be created, with API Credentials. An example Policy to attach to the IAM User (for a minimal permissions set) is as follows:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET NAME>"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET NAME>/*"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Example Kubernetes Cronjob

An example of how to schedule this container in Kubernetes as a cronjob is below. This would configure a database backup to run each day at 01:00am. The AWS Secret Access Key, and Target Database Password are stored in secrets.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
type: Opaque
data:
  aws_secret_access_key: <AWS Secret Access Key>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: TARGET_DATABASE_PASSWORD
type: Opaque
data:
  database_password: <Your Database Password>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
type: Opaque
data:
  slack_webhook_url: <Your Slack WebHook URL>
---
